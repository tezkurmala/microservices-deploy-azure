1. 
After adding following plugin, run   azure-webapp:config from eclipse RunAs Maven or
mvn azure-webapp:config from command line. 
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version>
</plugin>

2. Configuration would be added under the above <plugin> after azure-webapp:config is complete.
3. Modify <configuration> block as required if the auto generated is not as desired.
					<pricingTier>B1</pricingTier>
					<region>westeurope</region>
4.
Add <appSettings> under <configuration> to run the app on 80 port in azure. 
Otherwise, it will be defaulted to 8080.

					<appSettings>
						<property>
							<name>JAVA_OPTS</name>
							<value>-Dserver.port=80</value>
						</property>
					</appSettings>
5. Open Azure CLI 
Switch to the right folder
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\.NET SDK\v2.9>cd c:\ROOT\azuremicro\01-hello-world-rest-api
and Run 'mvn package' to create the jar locally. This jar will be picked by Azure webapp plugin for deployment.
6. From Azure CLI, Run mvn azure-webapp:deploy but this would fail because Azure login is not done.
7. From Azure CLI, do 'az login' and make sure we are in the right subscription.
8.
And run the mvn azure-webapp:deploy command
c:\ROOT\azuremicro\01-hello-world-rest-api>mvn azure-webapp:deploy
9. Access https://hello-world-rest-api-1.azurewebsites.net/hello-world
   https://hello-world-rest-api-1.azurewebsites.net/hello-world-bean

10. Any changes done to code? Skipping tests as we are just testing deployments.
  mvn clean install -DskipTests
  mvn azure-webapp:deploy

11. 
To see logs on Azure Portal
Under the App hello-world-rest-api-1
look at Log Stream
or Kudu console searchinig for Advanced Tools
Through Kudu Console we can see Log Stream
We can also do SSH into docker container 

Do not want to go to Azure Portal but refer to logs from Azure CLI?
	az webapp log tail --name hello-world-rest-api-1 --resource-group hello-world-rest-api-rg
	
However, Kudu Console - Environment tab - Deployment Logs - Container log, Docker log
are more reliable and instant.
